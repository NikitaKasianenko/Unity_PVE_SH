# Modular 3D Shooter (Prototype) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--development-orange)

This is a **prototype** of a 3D shooter developed in Unity, focused on modular architecture and animation-driven gameplay.  
The project is currently **in active development**.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

- **EventBus System** – decoupled communication between systems using custom events.
- **Modular Components** – systems like input, movement, combat, and UI are broken into isolated, maintainable modules.

## 🎮 Gameplay (In Progress)

- First-person shooter mechanics.
- Weapon handling system with modular logic.
- Player movement and aiming integrated with animations.

## 🎞️ Animation System

- Animation is a core focus of this project.
- Complex blend trees, layers, and transitions for fluid control.
- Runtime synchronization between logic and Animator parameters (movement, shooting, reloading, etc.).

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Unity (3D)**
- **C#**
- **Animator / Rigi**
- **Particle system**
- **EventBus** for decoupling

## 🧪 Project Status

- 🔧 **Work in Progress**
- 🎯 Current development focus:
  - Polish animation transitions
  - Build enemy AI prototype

## ✅ TODO

- [x] Implement core EventBus system  
- [x] Basic player movement with animation  
- [ ] Enemy detection and response  
- [x] Weapon switching and recoil logic  
- [ ] Scene-based game state management

## 📌 Purpose

This project is built to explore:
- Scalable and maintainable game architecture
- Deep animation-driven gameplay mechanics
- Decoupled systems and event-based communication
- Rapid prototyping and iterative design

---

> This prototype is part of a personal learning journey — exploring clean architecture, modularity, and high-quality animation workflows in Unity.
